# Sales-Data-Analysis-for-E-commerce
Abstract:
Sales Data Analysis is crucial for understanding the performance of products, customers, and overall sales trends in an e-commerce business. This project aims to analyze e-commerce sales data to extract key insights such as total revenue, product performance, and customer behavior. Using tools like Pandas and NumPy, the data is cleaned and preprocessed, followed by calculating key performance metrics like total revenue, average order value, and top-selling products. Visualizations will also be created using Matplotlib to present the sales trends over time, helping business stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

The analysis includes:
1. Cleaning and preprocessing sales data (handling missing values, duplicates).
2. Aggregating and analyzing sales metrics (revenue, orders, etc.).
3. Identifying the top-selling products and most valuable customers.
4. Visualizing trends over time to understand patterns in sales performance.
   Key Steps in Code:
1. Loading and Cleaning Data: The data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. Missing values are filled with `0`, and duplicates are removed.
2. Feature Engineering: A new column, `Total Revenue`, is created by multiplying `Quantity` and `Price`.
3. Calculating Metrics:
   - Total Revenue: The sum of all revenues.
   - Average Order Value (AOV): The mean value of all orders.
   - Top Products by Revenue: The top 10 products sorted by total revenue.
   - Top Customers by Total Spending: The top 10 customers who spent the most.
4. Sales Trends: Monthly sales trends are calculated using resampling and then plotted.
5. Visualizations:
   - Monthly revenue over time.
   - Bar chart for top 10 products.
   - Histogram of order values.
